# MANOC (Multi-Agent Nonparametric Overdose Control)
R codes to implement the multi-agent nonparametric overdose control design for dose finding in phase I drug-combination trials.

# Description
To enhance the robustness as well as safety of the design, we extend the non-parametric overdose control (NOC) design proposed by Lin and Yin (2016) to drug-combination trials. 
Under the Bayesian framework, the proposed multi-agent NOC (MANOC) design transforms dose finding into a model-selection problem in the model space composed with all paired dose combinations.
In the MANOC design, the dose-toxicity relationship is modelled solely based on the partial information of the toxicity order.
In addition, the posterior probability of each dose pair being the MTD combination is timely updated upon the availability
of new information. 
To prevent patients from experiencing excessive toxicities, the dose combination assigned to each new cohort of patients is determined by minimizing an asymmetric loss function, such that overdosing is penalized to some extent. 
Our nonparametric model specification in conjunction with the conservative dose-assignment scheme guarantee the MANOC design to be safe and yet maintain competitive performance for identifying the MTD combination.

# Functions

- MTDSelection.R: containing a function `MTDSelection()` for selecting a dose pair as the MTD combination. 
  `MTDSelection(y,n,target,p.sample.mat)`
- NextDoseComb.R: containing a function `get.next.manoc()` for determining the next dose combination.
  `get.next.manoc(y,n,target,p.sample.mat,delta,j_curr,k_curr,alpha,eta)`
- PosteriorProbability.R: containing a function `posteriorH()` for calculating the posterior model probability for each dose combination.

# Examples
We apply the MANOC design to the phase Ib trial with a combination of five doses of buparlisib and four doses of trametinib.

## Next Dose Level
If ten cohorts of patients have been enrolled and the corresponding number of patients treated at each dose combination *n* and the corresponding number of toxicities *y* are 
```rscript
> n
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    0    0    0    3    0
[2,]    0    0    3    3    0
[3,]    0    3    0    9    3
[4,]    3    0    0    0    3
> y
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    0    0    0    2    0
[2,]    0    0    0    2    0
[3,]    0    0    0    1    2
[4,]    0    0    0    0    0
```

Suppose the tenth cohort of patients is treated at the dose combination (1,5). To determine the dose combination at which the eleventh cohort of patients will be treated, we use the function `get.next.manoc()`.
```rscript
> rm(list=ls())
> setwd("/MANOC_master/")
> source("ToxProb_Generate.R")
> source("NextDoseComb.R")
> 
> target <- 0.33
> epi <- 0.025
> delta <- 0.05
> NN <- 50000
> 
> j_curr<-1
> k_curr<-5
> 
> alpha<-0.35
> eta<-0.55
> 
> n<-matrix(c(0,0,0,3, 0,0,3,0, 0,3,0,0, 3,3,9,0, 0,0,3,3),4,5)
> y<-matrix(c(0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0, 2,2,1,0, 0,0,2,0),4,5)
> ## Generate the matrices of p. ## 
> p.sample.mat <- generate_p.sample.mat(ndose.A=nrow(n),ndose.B=ncol(n), NN=NN, target=target, epi=epi) 
> get.next.manoc(y=y,n=n,target=target,delta=delta,p.sample.mat=p.sample.mat,j_curr=j_curr,k_curr=k_curr,alpha=alpha,eta=eta)
$next.dose
[1] 2 5
```
That is, we assign the eleventh cohort of patients to dose combination (2,5).

## MTD Selection
Suppose at the end of trial, the number of patients treated at each dose combination *n* and the corresponding number of toxicities *y* are 
```rscript
> n
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    0    0    0    3    0
[2,]    0    0    3    3    0
[3,]    0    3    0    9   39
[4,]    3    0    0    0    3
> y
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    0    0    0    2    0
[2,]    0    0    0    2    0
[3,]    0    0    0    1   12
[4,]    0    0    0    0    0
```
We can use the following codes to select the MTD combination. 
```rscript
> rm(list=ls())
> 
> setwd("/MANOC_master/")
> source("ToxProb_Generate.R")
> source("MTDSelection.R")
> 
> target <- 0.33
> epi <- 0.025
> NN <- 50000
> 
> n<-matrix(c(0,0,0,3, 0,0,3,0, 0,3,0,0, 3,3,9,0, 0,0,39,3),4,5)
> y<-matrix(c(0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0, 2,2,1,0, 0,0,12,0),4,5)
>
> p.sample.mat <- generate_p.sample.mat(ndose.A=nrow(n),ndose.B=ncol(n), NN=NN, target=target, epi=epi) 
> MTDSelection(y=y,n=n,target=target,p.sample.mat=p.sample.mat)
```
The output including the posterior probability of each dose combination and the selected MTD pair are respectively given by
```rscript
> MTDSelection(y=y,n=n,target=target,p.sample.mat=p.sample.mat)
$pos.model
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,] 0.01 0.05 0.15 0.06 0.00
[2,] 0.00 0.00 0.04 0.19 0.05
[3,] 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.42
[4,] 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.02
$MTD.sel
     row col
[1,]   2   5
```
Therefore, the dose pair (2,5) with the posterior probability 0.42 is selected as the MTD combination.

## Simulation Studies
Suppose the toxicity probability for each combination of the dose levels is given by
```rscript
> Tox_Prob_Mat
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,] 0.06 0.33 0.42 0.58 0.72
[2,] 0.03 0.15 0.24 0.38 0.53
[3,] 0.01 0.07 0.12 0.21 0.33
[4,] 0.01 0.03 0.06 0.10 0.18
```
We simulate 1000 trials to obtain the operating characteristics of the MANOC design with the target toxicity probability `phi=0.33` and the tuning parameters `alpha=0.35`, `delta=0.05`, `eta=0.55`, `epi=0.025`. The cohort size is three and the maximum number of patients is 66.

```
